STEMinists is a platform for women who are interested in all things STEM. Here, you can find information about female scientists who have excelled in their field as well as upcoming events and news. STEMinists also aims to provide statistics about women in STEM in order to raise awareness of gender-imbalance in the field.

Three pages are live at the moment. This includes the home page, contact us page and women in biology page. These serve as examples/templates of the different kind of pages that will make up the platform in full. The home page contains a variety of elements, including expanding notification bar which is responsive and allows for smaller screen sizes, becomes a collapsable notification bar instead of a standard one. The colours of the buttons change when you hover on them. It also contains responsive donut charts providing statistics. The footer also contains clickable links.

The contact us page provides a javascript notification if the user clicks send without filling out a field in the form.

The women in biology page contains information on female scientists formatted in columns, with a primary button that changes colour when you hover on it.

All pages have a sticky social media bar that when hovered over changes to pink. There is also a fixed header/notification bar that scrolls with the page.
